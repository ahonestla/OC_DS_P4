## 🏢 Predicting Seattle buildings consumption and emissions with machine learning 
OPENCLASSROOMS - Data Scientist - Project 4

This repository contains notebooks for a machine learning project that predicts energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions based on various features. 

### 📊 Data

The dataset used for this project is the [Seattle 2016 Building Energy Benchmarking](https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/2016-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2bpz-gwpy), which includes information on various features of buildings in Seattle city.
